This was a simple MMU I started for an MC-10 RAM upgrade written in PALASM (very old school)
It was just something to do while I sat with my mom in the nursing home,
and I'm pretty sure it isn't finished.  It definitely wasn't tested.
This was more sanity preservation than a serious design, but it's taking
up hard drive space so here it is.  
FWIW, it's more of a memory pager circuit than full blown MMU.
